    "This course is intended to be interactive (you will learn by doing things in groups and by watching me do it live and talking about it). I will use Jupyter, an environment that allows us to do everything in real time on the browser, so you will work locally on your computer and my working is visible on the projected screen. It basically allows you to take your own notes on the lecture notes, and run/modify the programs on your lecture notes. You will receive the course material before the course starts.\n",

    "This is a short course that introduces the participants to using Python in the broad fields of molecular biology and biochemistry. It was designed to be done in less than a week, four days at an optimum pace or three for those that are already introduced to Python programming. It starts with a tutorial like introduction to programming with Python, thus even people with extremely limited programming skills can participate. It then goes to present how Python can be used to make simple to advanced plots, how one can use Python for scientific computation and in the final part it takes the participant through every 'omics level with small scale projects that are discussed and modified in the classroom. Before the end of it, participants also learn how to use Python to interogate remote data and databases, use Python in the Cloud, and wrap calls to other programming languages.\n",

    "This course will not guarantee you will be a good programmer in three days. Today learning to program is as important as learning to write. But it takes years to become a good programmer. What is important is to persevere! There is an intent to also offer similarly short courses but with a more targeted scope, like sequencing, metabolic modeling and systems biology."

    "- April 2015 First time held at the Chemistry department of Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden. The format was 3 days, one day introduction, a second day scientific computing and a third day of practice.\n",

    "- May 2017: Chalmers Institute of Technology, Göteborg.\n",

    "For this next installment there was a change in course structure, with an additional full day being added. This was due to various reasons: there was not enough time for exercising, the course seemed a bit too packed, there were important chapters such as cloud computing and deep learning being left out."
